We have implemented a tic=tac-toe game in assembley language. In this we maintain a step counter which maintain the count of steps. if the steps are odd till now then its chance of y else it is a chance of x. Then it ask for the input from the console. Now if you put the invalid input that is less than 1 or greater than 9 or a place where already there is a mark then you get a wrong input msg and ask the input again else the matrix is printed.Now it checks if anyone has one or not or the case of draw.
